## Open Issues ##

1) GCloud: There is no place in Google Cloud Artifact Registry to store the Kubernetes manifest YAML files. Currently the files get applied
    directly with kubectl and the Jenkins jobs don't have reference to the files at the time of execution.

2) GCloud: There is no command to push images directly to Google Cloud Artifact Registry of type Docker unless it is of gcr.io domain.
            "gcr.io/${GCP_PROJECT}/$imageName:latest" --> works fine with docker push
            "${ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_LOCATION}-docker.pkg.dev/${GCP_PROJECT}/${ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_NAME}/$imageName:latest" --> Doesn't work

3) Ansible: Unable to execute skaffold commands and reference YAML file paths from the ansible playbook when not placed at the root dir.

4) Ansible: Could not use k8s_config to set the Kubectl Context in the playbook file.
            # - name: Load Kubernetes Configuration
            # k8s_config:
            #   context: KUBECTL_GCLOUD_CONTEXT

## Closed Issues ##

1) Ansible: Unable to connect to the remote Jenkins Agent Node via ssh using Ansible inventory file. Using localhost instead.
            Jenkins master is able to reach out to Agent node though.
   Soln:-   As the Jenkins job is running within the Agent Node itself and the tasks mentioned in the ansible playbook ideally
            should get executed on the Jenkins Agent node, localhost should suffice. Agent Node should have ansible installed already.
